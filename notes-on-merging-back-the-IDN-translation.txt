For the checked Indonesian translation file, later combine this through the ID and Indonesian (by excluding the English) columns because there are some errors in the English and these are corrected in the original Google Sheet files checked by Barnaby (links below). That means, we need to re-run the code in 4-pre-processing... file (namely, re-access the edited English translation in GSheet into R; DO THIS RE-ACCESSING AT THE VERY END AFTER CHECKING THE ENGLISH AND INDONESIAN TRANSLATIONS!)
